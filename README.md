# DImeta

**DImeta** is developed for metabolites annotation and quantification from direct injection mass spectrometry. 

This software primarily consists of three modules:/n 
  • Library import and reformatting module/n
  • graphical user interface (GUI) module/n 
  • metabolies identification module/n


Cosine similarity algorithm is applied for spectral comparison. 

Intensity of strongest fragment peak from MS2 spectrum as quantification basis.

For user convenience, this software includes a graphical user interface.
