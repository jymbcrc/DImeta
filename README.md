# DImeta

**DImeta** is developed for metabolites annotation and quantification from direct injection mass spectrometry. 

This software primarily consists of three modules: 
&#8226; Library import and reformatting module
&#8226; graphical user interface (GUI) module 
&#8226; metabolies identification module


Cosine similarity algorithm is applied for spectral comparison. 

Intensity of strongest fragment peak from MS2 spectrum as quantification basis.

For user convenience, this software includes a graphical user interface.
